Campaign analysis of banking marketing to sell fixed-term deposits.

This project was carried out in the context of the Data Science course at Digital House (Buenos Aires, Argentina) during 2021.

The chosen programming language was Python, implemented in Jupyter Lab.

The notebooks included here are editions made by me from those originally presented by the team.

The notebooks "3.desafio_final_grupo3_entrenamiento_logistico" and "3.ML_Boosting_algorithms" are authored solely by me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Predict the success of marketing campaigns on new clients. It aims to answer questions like "Who should we call?" and "What is the optimal number of calls that reduces the total campaign cost while maximizing the number of sales?"

A database is exploited where each row represents a bank customer and the columns refer to characteristics of the customer, bank contact, and macroeconomic context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The included notebooks are:

- Data Wrangling: 1.desafio_final_grupo3_limpieza
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): 2.desafio_final_grupo3_visualizacion
- Machine Learning: 3.ML_Boosting_algorithms and 3.desafio_final_grupo3_entrenamiento_logistico

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variables in the database are:

- 1 - age (numeric)
- 2 - job : type of job (categorical: "admin.","blue-collar","entrepreneur","housemaid","management","retired","self-employed","services","student","technician","unemployed","unknown")
- 3 - marital : marital status (categorical: "divorced","married","single","unknown"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)
- 4 - education (categorical: "basic.4y","basic.6y","basic.9y","high.school","illiterate","professional.course","university.degree","unknown")
- 5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
- 6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
- 7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: "no","yes","unknown")
related with the last contact of the current campaign:
- 8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: "cellular","telephone")
- 9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", â€¦, "nov", "dec")
- 10 - dayofweek: last contact day of the week (categorical: "mon","tue","wed","thu","fri")
- 11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y="no"). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
other attributes:
- 12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
- 13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
- 14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
- 15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "failure","nonexistent","success")
social and economic context attributes
- 16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
- 17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
- 18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
- 19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
- 20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)
Output variable (desired target):
- 21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: "yes","no")
Missing Attribute Values: There are several missing values in some categorical attributes, all coded with the "unknown" label. These missing values can be treated as a possible class label or using deletion or imputation techniques.
